# Audio Device Selection Fixes

## Problem

The audio device selection was too restrictive, only showing devices that had output channels but no input channels. This excluded many common audio devices like:

- Headsets (which have both input and output)
- USB audio interfaces
- Speakers with built-in microphones
- Virtual audio devices

## Solution

Fixed the device filtering logic in `src/models/audio_model.py`:

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed Device Filtering Logic**
   - **Before**: `d["max_output_channels"] > 0 and d["max_input_channels"] == 0`
   - **After**: `d["max_output_channels"] > 0`
   - This now includes any device that can play audio, regardless of input capabilities

2. **Added System Default Device Detection**
   - Automatically detects and marks the system default audio device
   - Shows default device with ðŸ”Š icon and "(Default)" label at the top of the list

3. **Enhanced Device Validation**
   - Added `is_device_available()` method to check if a device is still connected
   - Added proper validation before playing audio to specific devices
   - Fallback to system default if selected device is unavailable

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Improved error messages with device names and IDs
   - Multiple fallback levels: specific device â†’ pygame default â†’ Windows beep
   - Graceful handling of disconnected devices

5. **Device Refresh Capability**
   - Added `refresh_devices()` method to update device list
   - Added `refresh_audio_devices()` in main controller
   - Automatic device refresh when current device becomes unavailable

## Test Results

- **Before**: Limited to output-only devices (usually 2-4 devices)
- **After**: Shows all available output devices (12 devices in test)
- All device types now properly detected and usable

## Files Modified

- `src/models/audio_model.py` - Core audio device handling
- `src/controllers/main_controller.py` - Device selection and refresh logic
- `test_audio_fixes.py` - Test script to verify fixes

The application now properly detects and allows selection of all available audio output devices, independent of their input capabilities.
